As you can imagine from what you have read on this website, these amazing people know what they want to do and how to do it. Apart from their disability, 
with which they have learnt to live through sheer determination, their primary need is for funds to pay for the training and the seeds and tools that 
allow them to transform their newly-found knowledge into reality on the ground. £20 will pay for seeds of most crops for an acre, £50 will pay for
a complete set of tools or for one day of the seven-day training course. Such donations can be made using the QR code below or through this link.

There is a well-known slogan that "every little helps" and this cannot be more true for the inspiring project that is Farming on Crutches. 
Thank you for your interest in our work.
