			As you can imagine from what you have read on this website, these amazing people know what they want to do
			and how to do
			it. Apart from their disability, with which they have learnt to live through sheer determination, their
			primary need is
			for funds to pay for the training and the seeds and tools that allow them to transform their newly-found
			knowledge into
			reality on the ground.

		<div class="section-paragraph">
			<b>£20</b> will pay for seeds of most crops for an acre, <b>£50</b> will pay for a complete set of tools or
			for one day of the seven-day training course.
