            A Love of a Game

        <div class="section-paragraph">
            One of the poorest countries in the world, Sierra Leone experienced 11 years of civil war (1991-2002). More
            than 50,000
            people died. Many others lost limbs through amputation. Following the civil war, the Ebola epidemic (2014 –
            2015) killed
            over 8,000 people and devastated the country’s major source of livelihood; agriculture and education
            infrastructures
            were left in limbo.

            In 2001, <b>Mambud Samai</b> was living in a refugee camp in Guinea and
            became
            conscious of those who had lost a limb from a machete used as a weapon of terror or from a stray bullet. He
            also learnt
            about the game of amputee football that was emerging - particularly in the US. He contacted………, who was
            behind the
            development of the game, and decided to set up a small organisation that would bring amputees together and
            provide a
            sense of community and fellowship through playing football together. The dream became a reality in the form
            of the
            Sierra Leone Amputee Sports Association (SLASA) and for a number of years the focus was entirely on playing
            football,
            gradually extending beyond the capital through establishing leagues in the other four provinces in which
            both men and
            women could play.

            Growth
        </div>
        <div class="section-paragraph">
            In 2010, the then UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon donated to SLASA a three-acre plot of land in the
            outskirts of
            Freetown for possible use as a training ground. But it lay idle as there were no funds available to make use
            of the
            land. In 2018, Mambud had the opportunity to spend 9 months on a rural leadership course at the <a href="https://ari.ac.jp/en/home/">Asian Rural
            Institute</a> in
            Japan which included intensive training not only in rural leadership and community development but also
            sustainable
            development. Here “the participants undergo a deeply transformative learning experience that helps them find
            solutions
            to their communities’ most pressing challenges. The Motto That we may live together. During many classroom
            lectures,
            discussions, and observation trips, they get to see different models of farming and gain deeper insight of
            how food is
            related to broader social and economic issues. In all of this, ARI’s concept of Foodlife enlightens
            participants’
            understanding of Sustainable Agriculture. Every day, they practice integrated farming, making and using
            organic
            fertilizer, managing pests with local materials, and using appropriate technologies to protect the
            ecological system of
            the living soil for future generations and have ownership over their Foodlife”.

					Mambud returned full of enthusiasm but with nowhere to practice the agricultural knowledge that he had
            learned….until
            early in 2020 when an opportunity arose to make an application to the LUSH FOUNDATION. This resulted in a
            grant of
            £25,000, which transformed the three-acre site from waste land into a fenced and functioning farm with a
            training centre
            that has overnight accommodation, solar power, a well and trickle irrigation. Details of the early progress
            made on the
            farm since then were presented to the 2021 Oxford Real Farming Conference and can be found here in which
            Mambud is
            accompanied by one of the trainers, a local farmer and a local volunteer schoolteacher. In 2023 Mambud was
            recognised by
            CNN as a changemaker and made a film about him and his work which you will find here (and a shortened
            version <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/03/sport/slasa-mambud-samai-sierra-leone-amputee-football-spc-spt-intl/index.html">here</a>). In
            the last two years funds have been received from the <a href="https://groundswellag.com">Groundswell Regenerative Farming Festival</a>, from the <a href="https://www.betheearth.foundation">Be
            the Earth
            Foundation</a> and from members of the pastoral farming community – in particular though <a href="https://www.pastureforlife.org">Pasture for Life</a> –
            which has funded
            three one-week training courses for 45 amputees. The immediate priority continues to be to lay on more of
            these one-week
            courses so that all the members of the SLASA community can be trained in sustainable farming and be provided
            with the
            resources to start their own farms.

            In the UK the main link has been <b>John Meadley</b>, who has spent more than five decades engaged with rural
            communities in
            Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. He first went to Sierra Leone in the late 1970s to assist in areas relating
            to the
            purchasing of peanuts (and later other products such as rice and ginger) directly from farmers as well as in
            the
            expansion of cocoa and coffee production in the Eastern Region. He returned to Sierra Leone in 2001 to lead
            a British
            mission to assess how the UK could support the regeneration of rural life as the civil war was coming to an
            end and to
            become involved in the implementation of the resulting programme. It was during this time that he became
            acutely aware
            of the large number of amputees resulting from the brutality of the warring factions. In 2012 he took his
            son Tom, then
            16, to Sierra Leone to introduce him to the country and its people and it was whilst there that they came
            across the
            amputee footballers playing on Lumley Beach and that was the beginning of the relationship. Two years later,
            SLASA got
            through to the knock-out rounds of the World Amputee Football Cup and asked Tom to write their theme song –
            which he did
            and which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFCo0bvwBNE">here</a>. Sadly, they were unable to continue in the competition due to Ebola.

            Contact continued during the coming years until 2018 when Mambud was invited to participate in the course at
            ARI in
            Japan. On his return the idea of developing the three-acre site as a training farm emerged - which the LUSH
            funds
            translated into a reality. John has continued to mobilise funds in the UK and to communicate regularly with
            Mambud as
            the project has evolved. He is also the co-founder and Hon President of the <a href="https://www.pastureforlife.org">Pasture for Life</a> movement, which
            encourages
            farmers to raise their ruminant animals wholly on pasture, and so brings with him the experience and
            friendship of this
            pioneering group of farmers.

            <b>Pete Belk</b> went to Sierra Leone in 2013-14 as a volunteer for a year to
            work with The
            Collective Sierra Leone. That experience, and an affection for Sierra Leone, has remained with him. A chance
            meeting
            with John introduced him to Farming on Crutches and led to his close involvement in building the UK support
            network.
            Pete grew up working on farms in mid-Wales. He has since spent 15 years working in a variety of
            sustainability focused
            roles encompassing campaigning, leadership development, responsible business strategy and more recently
            focusing on
            nature recovery with Natural England and Gloucestershire County Council. His brother-in-law, Chris Jones ,
            helped to
            design the Farming on Crutches logo.
