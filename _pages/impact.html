    This transformation from disability into opportunity starts on the three-acre farm during a one-week course of training. Participants leave not
    only with knowledge but also with tools and seeds and a small amount of cash to permit them to start farming at home. As well as earning a living, they
    become changemakers in their communities, generating respect in the process.

  Amodu Amara is an Amputee footballer and farmer. He lives in Bo City. In the video he is
  introducing his farm after the training course. He said, he is planting cucumber, maize, and
  okra and he is practicing the sustainable agriculture training he just learnt from the SLASA.
  Today he is saying, &quot;my family can earn 50 Leones (Â£2) very early in the morning just on
  vegetable sales for money for our pocket and in addition we take home some
  harvest for family consumption. The community say that they admire him. He is speaking
  Creole but you will pick out words like "sustainable agriculture", "hard work" and
  "admired"!
