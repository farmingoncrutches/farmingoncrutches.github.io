		<div class="section-paragraph">
			<strong>SLASA trained 45 farmers on crutches in 2022, most of whom have gone on to setup farms and
				enterprises in their communities.</strong>

		<div class="section-paragraph">
			This transformation from disability into opportunity starts on the three-acre farm during a one-week course
			of training.
			Participants leave not only with knowledge but also with tools and seeds and a small amount of cash to
			permit them to
			start farming at home. As well as earning a living, they become changemakers in their communities,
			generating respect in
			the process.

					Amodu Amara also trained in November 2022 and is intercropping cucumber, maize, and okra - feeding

					lives in Bo City. In the video he is introducing his farm after the
					training course. He said, he is planting cucumber, maize, and okra and he is practicing the
					sustainable agriculture
					training he just learnt from the SLASA. Today he is saying, "my family can earn 50 Leones (Â£2) very
					early in the morning
					just on vegetable sales for money for our pocket and in addition we take home some harvest for
					family consumption. The
					community say that they admire him. He is speaking Creole but you will pick out words like
					"sustainable agriculture",
					"hard work" and "admired"!
