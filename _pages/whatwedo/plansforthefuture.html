PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.
Within Sierra Leone.

<div>
    Extending the training to all members of SLASA. We have made a good start
    but so far only 45 of the 350 members of SLASA have had the opportunity to participate in a
    training course so providing that opportunity to all members is an absolute priority.
</div>

<div>
    Bee-keeping on crutches. Thanks to support from Bees Abroad and building on the
    experience of the Rory’s Well project, where bee-keeping has been successfully introduced
    as a new source of livelihood with significant opportunities for adding value, work has
    started on adapting bee-keeping to be accessible to those with a single limb.
</div>

<div>
    Demonstration farms. We want to extend our nature-friendly approach to farming, free
    from chemicals and as far a possible free from debt, not only to the amputee community
    but also to those who are able-bodied. So plans are being developed to establish a
    demonstration farm in each of the four provinces outside Freetown. A condition for the
    development of such farms is that the land, which generally makes up half of the cost of
    developing the farm, is donated by the local community. We aim to encourage increased
    awareness of, and the transfer of knowledge to, rural changemakers on ecological,
    conservational and environmental issues within the local context. The communities will gain
    practical education on how to develop and carry out sustainable agricultural management
    practices.
</div>

<div>
    Establishing the training farm as a centre of excellence. Many lessons are being learned
    from these training courses and from the management of the farm which are being
    captured for future use. The aim is to strengthen PAF’s ability to share such knowledge
    online both within and outside Sierra Leone, through training courses and written material.
    There are also possibilities to extend the training beyond soil-based farming into areas such
    as bee-keeping (already started with Bees Abroad) and adding value to raw produce through
    drying, fermenting, storage and packaging etc.
</div>

<div>
    Building a small management team. Like most new initiatives, Farming on Crutches is very
    dependent upon one or two key people and there is a need to build a small team that can
    manage the farm, run training courses, monitor and mentor the trainees, raise funds and
    account for them, raise its profile in the media and respond to enquiries from both home
    and abroad.
</div>

<div>
    Outside Sierra Leone. SLASA’s reputation was originally built on empowering amputees
    through football. Amputee football is played in 18 other countries across Africa – Liberia,
    Gambia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, DR Congo,
    Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Morocco, Egypt, Angola and Rwanda. There is an opportunity
    to share the knowledge and experience of the farm with these countries and encourage
    them to establish their own training facility based on the model in Sierra Leone.
</div>

<div>
    With this mind, we want to invite one representative from each of these countries to attend
    a training session in Sierra Leone. This will provide both experience of what is on offer and
    an opportunity to identify what modifications may be needed to implement the programme
    under their home conditions – conscious that farming is highly dependent upon the local
    conditions – soils, climate, crop species, traditions, markets etc. With six such representatives spending a week on a training course and with nine
    counterparts from Sierra Leone this could be achieved through holding three such courses.
