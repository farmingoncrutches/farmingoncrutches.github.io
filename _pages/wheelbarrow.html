            If you are a small farmer or market gardener a wheelbarrow is pretty central to your work – for moving
            around tools,
            compost, soil, leaves and produce. Using one is something we take for granted. However, it doesn’t work if
            you have only
            one leg or one arm. As you can see in this picture, the only person who can push it is the one with the good
            fortune to
            have a prosthetic leg.

                    During the most recent training course, held in September, a small group of amputees – both men and
                    women representing
                    both those with one leg and one arm – set about designing a wheelbarrow that would work for them and
                    which could be
                    produced as far as possible from local materials. The chosen materials were timber (which had to be
                    purchased) and
                    bamboo (which was growing on the farm). The other key elements were the two bicycle wheels and the
                    forks to hold them.
                    As you can see in the pictures below, the design evolved throughout the training course resulting in
                    the prototype that
                    you can see at the end

            Ebenezer John on his crutches. Further adaptations of the original
            design are anticipated in the light of practical experience.

            This is a prototype that is to be tested in the field – when they will be looking at ways of further
            reducing the cost
            and improving the weight-transfer – perhaps through moving the wheels to a different position.
            As the major cost is the (bicycle) wheels it is hoped that, in due course, they can be sourced from one or
            more of the
            organisations in the UK that collects and refurbishes bikes. The target is to be able to provide every one
            of our
            amputee farmers with such a wheelbarrow.
