			Farming on Crutches seeks to farm in tune with nature, without chemicals and as far as possible without debt
			- based on the principles of agro-ecology and permaculture. The compelling benefits from training and
			supporting the changemakers in these practices focused on community localization and revitalization are
			that;
			<ul>
				<li>It enhances food security and human health whilst reducing financial risks</li>
				<li>It eliminates the need for synthetic fertilisers and plant protection chemicals</li>
				<li>It protects the forests from deforestation and reduces erosion</li>
				<li>It rebuilds habitats to preserve biodiversity and aids in sequestering carbon</li>
				<li>It provides new economic opportunities for both amputees and whole-bodied
					people and increases the attractiveness of the rural areas as a place to live and
					earn a living.</li>
			</ul>

			The principles underlying Farming on Crutches are the same as those espoused by <a
				href="https://ari.ac.jp/en/curriculum/">ARI</a> – namely to build an
			environmentally
			healthy, just and peaceful world. ARI’s concept of Foodlife enlightens participants’ understanding of
			Sustainable
			Agriculture. Every day, they practice integrated farming, making and using organic fertiliser, managing
			pests with local
			materials and using appropriate technologies to protect the ecological system of the living soil for future
			generations
			and to have ownership over their Foodlife. ARI’s principles are summarised below and are broadly in line
			with those of
			Agroecology and Permaculture (see boxes below). As can be seen below, Farming on Crutches addresses all of
			the
			sustainable development goals that are relevant to farming and rural life.

			A fundamental element of this approach is Bokashi – a form of composting which makes use of green and
			brown
			waste and
			other organic together with micro- organisms – in Sierra Leone collected from forest soils - to produce
			an
			effective
			source of nutrients and soil improvement. To learn more about the making of Bokashi, both on our farm
			and on
			other farms
			around the world, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0KfmE4vBsA">this webinar</a> in which
			Mambud is the second speaker. (More to be added from Mambud

			THE PRINCIPLES OF Agroecology
		</div>
		<div class="section-paragraph">
			Agroecology is sustainable farming that works with nature. Ecology is the study of relationships between
			plants,
			animals, people and their environment – and the balance between these relationships. It is the
			application
			of ecological
			concepts and principles in farming and is defined by the <a
				href="https://www.fao.org/agroecology/home/en/">FAO</a> as a holistic and integrated approach that
			simultaneously
			applies ecological and social concepts and principles to the design and management of sustainable
			agriculture and food
			systems. It seeks to optimise the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment while
			also addressing
			the need for socially equitable food systems within which people can exercise choice over what they eat
			and
			how and
			where it is produced. Agroecology is currently a science, a set of practices and a social movement and
			has
			evolved as a
			concept over recent decades to expand in scope from a focus on fields and farms to encompass the
			entirety of
			agriculture
			and food systems. It now represents a trans-disciplinary field that includes the ecological,
			socio-cultural,
			technological, economic and political dimensions for food systems through from food production to
			consumption.
