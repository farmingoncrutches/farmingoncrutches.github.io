The principles underlying Farming on Crutches are the same as those espoused by <a href="https://ari.ac.jp/en/curriculum/">ARI</a> – namely to build an environmentally
healthy, just and peaceful world. ARI’s concept of Foodlife enlightens participants’ understanding of Sustainable Agriculture.
Every day, they practice integrated farming, making and using organic fertiliser, managing pests with local materials and using
appropriate technologies to protect the ecological system of the living soil for future generations and to have ownership over their Foodlife. ARI’s principles are summarised
below and are broadly in line with those of Agroecology and Permaculture (see boxes below). As can be seen below, Farming on Crutches addresses all of the sustainable
development goals that are relevant to farming and rural life.

	A fundamental element of this approach is Bokashi – a form of composting which makes use of green and brown waste and other organic together with micro- organisms – in Sierra Leone
	collected from forest soils - to produce an effective source of nutrients and soil improvement. To learn more about the making of Bokashi, both on our farm and on other farms around the world,
	watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0KfmE4vBsA">this webinar</a> in which Mambud is the second speaker. (More to be added from Mambud about this and the general farming system).

			Agroecology is sustainable farming that works with nature. Ecology is the study of
			relationships between plants, animals, people and their environment – and the balance
			between these relationships. It is the application of ecological concepts and principles in
			farming and is <a href="https://www.fao.org/agroecology/home/en/">defined by the FAO</a> as a holistic and integrated approach that
			simultaneously applies ecological and social concepts and principles to the design and
			management of sustainable agriculture and food systems. It seeks to optimise the
			interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment while also addressing
			the need for socially equitable food systems within which people can exercise choice over
			what they eat and how and where it is produced. Agroecology is currently a science, a set
			of practices and a social movement and has evolved as a concept over recent decades to
			expand in scope from a focus on fields and farms to encompass the entirety of agriculture
			and food systems. It now represents a trans-disciplinary field that includes the ecological,
			socio-cultural, technological, economic and political dimensions for food systems through
			from food production to consumption.
