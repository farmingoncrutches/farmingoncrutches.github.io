			Farming on Crutches (FoC) empowers those in Sierra Leone who have lost a limb to be able to farm
			organically - through
			the experience and activities of the <strong>Sierra Leone Amputee Sports Association Permaculture
				and
				Agro-ecological Farm
				(SLASA-PAF)</strong>. This transformation from disability into opportunity starts on a
			three-acre farm during
			a one-week course
			of training in theory and practice. You can get an idea of what happens on the course in this short
			film. Participants
			leave the course not only with knowledge but also with tools and seeds and a small amount of cash to
			permit them to
			start farming at home. As well as being able to earn a living, they become changemakers in their
			communities, generating
			respect in the process.

			Extending the training to all members of SLASA. We have made a good start but so far only 45 of the
			350 members of SLASA
			have had the opportunity to participate in a training course so providing that opportunity to all

				<div class="paragraph">
					Thanks to support from <a href="https://beesabroad.org.uk">Bees Abroad</a> and building on the
					experience of the Rory’s Well project, where
					bee-keeping has been
					successfully introduced as a new source of livelihood with significant opportunities for adding
					value, work has started
					on adapting bee-keeping to be accessible to those with a single limb.

				<div class="paragraph">
					We want to extend our nature-friendly approach to farming, free from chemicals and as far a possible
					free from debt, not
					only to the amputee community but also to those who are able-bodied. So plans are being developed to
					establish a
					demonstration farm in each of the four provinces outside Freetown. A condition for the development
					of such farms is that
					the land, which generally makes up half of the cost of developing the farm, is donated by the local
					community. We aim to
					encourage increased awareness of, and the transfer of knowledge to, rural changemakers on
					ecological, conservational and
					environmental issues within the local context. The communities will gain practical education on how
					to develop and carry
					out sustainable agricultural management practices.

				<div class="title">Establishing the training farm as a centre of excellence</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Many lessons are being learned from these training courses and from the management of the farm which
					are being captured
					for future use. The aim is to strengthen PAF’s ability to share such knowledge online both within
					and outside Sierra
					Leone, through training courses and written material. There are also possibilities to extend the
					training beyond
					soil-based farming into areas such as bee-keeping (already started with Bees Abroad) and adding
					value to raw produce
					through drying, fermenting, storage and packaging etc.

				<div class="title">Building a small management team</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Like most new initiatives, Farming on Crutches is very dependent upon one or two key people and
					there is a need to build
					a small team that can manage the farm, run training courses, monitor and mentor the trainees, raise
					funds and account
					for them, raise its profile in the media and respond to enquiries from both home and abroad.

		<div class="section-paragraph">
			SLASA’s reputation was originally built on empowering amputees through football. Amputee football is played
			in 18 other
			countries across Africa – Liberia, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Cameroon, Kenya,
			Uganda, DR Congo,
			Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Morocco, Egypt, Angola and Rwanda. There is an opportunity to share the
			knowledge and
			experience of the farm with these countries and encourage them to establish their own training facility
			based on the
			model in Sierra Leone.
			With this mind, we want to invite one representative from each of these countries to attend a training
			session in Sierra
			Leone. This will provide both experience of what is on offer and an opportunity to identify what
			modifications may be
			needed to implement the programme under their home conditions – conscious that farming is highly dependent
			upon the
			local conditions – soils, climate, crop species, traditions, markets etc. With six such representatives
			spending a week
			on a training course and with nine counterparts from Sierra Leone this could be achieved through holding
			three such
			courses.
